I am now a PhD student at the Institute of Space and Earth Information Science, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. My PhD programme is Earth System and GeoInformation Science. I study how and to what extent environmental impacts will affect human behavior. I am particularly interested in applying big data (e.g. spatiotemporal geographic data) and machine learning to resolve concrete social problems (e.g. unfair air pollution exposure among different regions and groups). In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton and hiking.
