I was pleased to attend the AAG 2025 meeting and the International Geospatial Health Research Network (IGHRN) session in Detroit from March 24–28, 2025. Throughout the event, I observed that many sessions focused on GEOAI, highlighting innovative AI models—such as explainable machine learning, deep learning algorithms, and large language models—applied to geography and health research. However, should AI serve as the primary benchmark for research and publication? A discussion suggested that it may be not. At times, AI techniques may be over popular, potentially leading to their abuse or misuse. Back to the begainning of research, it should begin with clearly defined questions, followed by the application of appropriate methods, whether AI-based or not–the most suitable approach is preferable.

很高兴能参加2025年3月24日至28日在底特律举行的AAG 2025会议和国际地理空间健康研究网络（IGHRN）会议。在整个活动中，我观察到许多会议都集中在GEOAI上，突出了应用于地理和健康研究的创新人工智能模型，如可解释的机器学习、深度学习算法和大型语言模型。然而，人工智能应该作为研究和出版的主要基准吗？一场讨论表明，它可能不是。有时，人工智能技术可能过于流行，可能导致它们被滥用或误用。回到研究的初心，它应该从明确定义的问题开始，然后应用适当的方法，无论是否基于人工智能——最合适的方法是可取的。
